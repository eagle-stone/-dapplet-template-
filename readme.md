# EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector

### Introduction
This is a tensorflow re-implementation of [EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155v2).
The features are summarized blow:
+ Online demo
	+ http://east.zxytim.com/
	+ Result example: http://east.zxytim.com/?r=48e5020a-7b7f-11e7-b776-f23c91e0703e
	+ CAVEAT: There's only one cpu core on the demo server. Simultaneous access will degrade response time.
+ Only **RBOX** part is implemented.
+ A fast Locality-Aware NMS in C++ provided by the paper's author.
+ The pre-trained mode
